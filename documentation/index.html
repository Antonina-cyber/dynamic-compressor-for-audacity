    <h2>Chris&#8217;s dynamic compressor</h2>
      <div class="entrytext">
                <p><b>Update: </b> 1.2.7 beta 1 version released. Interesting new feature! See below.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve written a program that makes it easier to listen to classical music, or other music that has a wide range of volumes, at low volumes or in high noise conditions (such as in your car) so that you can still hear the soft parts. I&#8217;ve also written a plugin version, designed to be used with the free audio editor <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">Audacity</a>. You can read about the background and rationale of the plugin <a href="rationale/index.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>For you to hear it in action, I&#8217;ve provided three 30 second clips of the fourth piece from Debussy&#8217;s Children&#8217;s Corner suite, The Snow is Falling. They use version 1.1 of the compressor, so results will differ slightly, and the settings are named differently. The <a href="../../projects/compressor/snow-unc.mp3">first</a> has no adjustment, the <a href="../../projects/compressor/snow-c1.5.mp3">second</a> has compression applied with both rise and fall speed at the default 1.5 dB/s, and the <a href="../../projects/compressor/snow-c5.mp3">third</a> has compression applied with fall and rise speed set to a more aggressive 5 dB/s.</p>
<p>It was a lot of fun to program. I hope a lot of people get some good use out of it. I hope it allows me, and possibly you, to enjoy our classical music more often, and to more easily share it with our friends.</p>
<h3><a name="download"></a>Download and Use</h3>
<p>My program currently comes in two versions. One is a standalone program, both with a GUI and console interface. It&#8217;s useful for batch processing, and allows you to directly compress to/from MP3s (Lame required). (Audacity doesn&#8217;t currently support batch processing using a Nyquist plugin.) Download version 1.2.6 <a href="../../projects/compressor/Compressor-dotnet.zip">here</a>. It requires the .NET framework version 3.5 (or Mono 1.9). If you&#8217;re using the GUI version, check out the commandline version for explanations of the parameters. People have reported problems using this version on Vista and Windows 7. (Specifically, the output is playing back at double speed.) I doubt the OS is the problem, but I&#8217;ve had no reports of problems on XP. You can try it anyway, or you can contact me and help me debug it and fix the problem.</p>
<p>The other is an Audacity plugin, currently at version 1.2.6 (or, below, a beta version 1.2.7). To use it, <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/download/?lang=en">download</a> and install Audacity. Download the <a href="../../projects/compressor/compress.ny">plugin source</a> (i.e. right click on that link and select &#8220;Save target as&#8230;&#8221; or your browser&#8217;s equivalent), and put it in your audacity plugins directory, which should be under the main install directory. On windows, that&#8217;s usually C:\Program Files\Audacity\plugins. On unix, /usr/[local/]share/audacity/plugins. On OS X, /Applications/Audacity/plug-ins. Your browser, if it sucks, might insist on saving the file with a &#8220;.txt&#8221; extension behind your back. If it does, you&#8217;ll have to remove this to get the plugin installed.</p>
<p><a href="../../projects/compressor/compress-b1.ny">1.2.7 beta 1</a> is a new version of the audacity plugin with an experimental feature enabled by default (at the bottom of the parameters screen). It might give better results, especially for very low volume listening (which includes listening in noisy environments, such as in cars). It adjusts for the extra sensitivity people have to frequencies in the 3-7 kHz range, i.e. bright or brassy sounds. It doesn&#8217;t change the tone, but it makes bright sounds softer than it otherwise would, to give a perceptually more even volume, even though the actual amplitude is less equal. Try it out if you like. Let me know what you think. (I tried a feature to compensate for the lesser sensitivity to bass sounds, but the results were terrible for some reason.)</p>
<p>If your music is on CD, use a CD ripping program to make a .wav file of each track. You can encode the wav file (to mp3, ogg, etc.) after you&#8217;ve applied the dynamic compression. Use Audacity to open the sound file. Select the whole thing, then go to the Effects menu, to the bottom at Plugins (or below the horizontal divider), and select &#8220;Compress dynamics&#8230;&#8221;. Adjust the settings to your liking, and click OK. To save your changes, you need to go to File \\ Export wav or Export mp3. File \\ Save will not do what you want it to.</p>
<p>The plugin version has advanced options (including separate attack/release speeds) that can be activated by downloading <a href="../../projects/compressor/compress-adv.ny">this version</a>, or by following the instructions in the .ny file. If you&#8217;re used to having finer control over your compressor, you might consider these. (They&#8217;re explained in <a href="options-explained/index.html">the tutorial</a>.)</p>
<p>For the most part, the default settings will work just fine. The first setting is the main one, letting you choose how heavy or light to compress.</p>
<h3>Tutorial</h3>
<p><a href="options-explained/index.html">Here.</a></p>
<h3>Changes in 1.2.6</h3>
<p>For the plugin: Hide a bunch of advanced options by default and replace them with a single option that should be sufficient for 99% of uses. Clarify documentation a bit.</p>
<p>For the standalone: Throw an error when the WAV file isn&#8217;t in the expected format. Also, try to handle long RIFF subchunks before the data chunk better.</p>
<h3>Changes in 1.2.5</h3>
<p>1.2.2 introduced a problem where memory usage was very high, so it probably didn&#8217;t work on very long inputs. It didn&#8217;t work on mono inputs either.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s just pretend 1.2.4 never happened.</p>
<h3>Changes in 1.2.3</h3>
<p>1.2.2 was broken on longish inputs (more than a few minutes) due to a bug in Nyquist. I was able to work around the bug.</p>
<h3>Changes in 1.2.2</h3>
<p>Two bugs were fixed. One caused tracks to be truncated sometimes after a period of silence in the track. The other caused inappropriate volume gains on certain parts of the track, usually at the end. (Specifically, the compression was being applied about 1/30 sec too soon.) Neither of these bugs were present in the program version.</p>
<h3>Changes in 1.2.1</h3>
<p>A simple noise gate is added. The floor is specified in decibels now, instead of linear.</p>
<h3>Changes in 1.2</h3>
<p>A completely different compression algorithm is used, based on parabolas instead of lines. It strikes a better balance between fast and slow changes, by varying its rate of change so that the envelope doesn&#8217;t leave so much empty space (i.e. low-volume sections) without losing too much transparency. You get a couple more parameters to play with. You can emulate the behavior of the old version by setting the exponent parameters to 1. The audacity version has much better memory usage (and thus, speed) on larger inputs than the previous version.</p>
<h3>Changes in 1.1</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bugfix. It caused some areas to be amplified way too much on files, especially when the rise and fall speed were too high.
</li>
<li>Renamed existing parameters to more conventional things for compressors.
</li>
<li>Added a noise floor parameter, which lets you leave alone (apply a constant gain) parts of the audio below a threshold.
</li>
<li>Added a compression ratio parameter, which lets you not bring everything all the way up to the same level, and also do weird things with ratios outside the normal range.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Code</h3>
<p>Download the code using the <a href="http://bazaar-vcs.org/">Bazaar revision control system</a> from http://pdf23ds.net/bzr/Compressor/trunk .</p>
<h3>How it works (technical details)</h3>
<p>First you resample down by a factor of 1500 or so using the max and abs functions to get a representation of the volume of the sound at any given point (the input envelope); Then you construct a compression envelope around the input envelope that &#8220;hugs&#8221; it in just the right way, and then you drag up the compression envelope points to 0 dB (and the volume of the input sound with it), i.e. you multiply the input sound by (1 - 1 / the compression envelope) * the compression ratio (or something like that&#8212;you get the idea, I think).</p>
<p>My compressor calculates its compression envelope thus: It first calculates a &#8220;paraboloid&#8221;, which is what I call the function</p>
<blockquote><p>f(x) = x > 0 ? a1*x^b1 : a2*x^b2</p></blockquote>
<p>where a1,2 and b1,2 are parameters to the compressor. b1 and b2 are set by default to 4 and 2 respectively, which I think is the key to the compressor&#8217;s effectiveness. Then it tries to fit sections of this paraboloid to hug, as closely as possible, the input envelope without going under it (which would cause clipping). It turns out there&#8217;s a unique fitting that&#8217;s the best, and it&#8217;s pretty simple to calculate using lookahead with a trial-and-error technique.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s basically it. In versions earlier than 1.2, I had the simpler idea of using straight lines instead of curves, which gives OK results, but not quite as nice.</p>

      <div class="comment"><p>Thanks for this fantastic compressor. I&#8217;m using it to level the speech in the latest episode of my podcast. The one built into Audacity must have a non-zero attack time, which results in every new segment of speech beginning with a loud blast. I was actually looking for Nyquist samples so that I could write my own leveler. You&#8217;ve not only saved me hours of fine-tuning per episode, but days or weeks of research and development.</p>
<p>I record each person on a separate track, so there are long periods of silence on each track while that person is listening. I&#8217;m experiencing a strange artifact during those portions where the volume would turn up and I would hear that person breathing. But I think that adjusting the floor will take care of that problem.</p>
<p>Thanks for all your hard work. It&#8217;s a real time saver.</p>

      <div class="comment"><p>For those, I would definitely try to manually correct for the individual gunshots. (The Nutcracker?) Audacity has a volume envelope tool that you can use to precisely deal with that sort of thing. If you still want to use the plugin to do that, at the very top of the .ny file there&#8217;s the definitions for the parameters, that you can edit to change the allowed range.</p>

      <div class="comment"><p>Wow, your compressor works really well. I agree with Michael, it&#8217;s good enough to use for podcast and (homebrew) radio production.</p>
<p>Hope you don&#8217;t mind a feature request:<br />
Is it possible to add a flag, so that the compression would only be performed on a single channel (left/right) based on either the volume of this channel or the combined volume of both? </p>
<p>This would allow mono &#8220;talk-over&#8221; effects if you record your spoken track on one channel and have music on the other. First you could compress the voice channel and then the music in a way that it whenever something is spoken on the other channel, the music stays in the background to immediately return afterwards.</p>

      <div class="comment"><p>Dan, I think that the option you&#8217;re looking for is really more of a separate plugin. The basic idea would be to take a volume envelope of the compressed voice track, invert it, and scale the background track to follow the inverted envelope. That sounds like a five line plugin to me, but I&#8217;m not up to writing it anytime soon. If I had to guess, it&#8217;d look something like</p>
<p>(mult background-snd (invert (snd-avg voice-snd 2000 1000 op-peak)))</p>
<p>where &#8220;invert&#8221; isn&#8217;t actually a Nyquist function, and you extract the &#8220;background-snd&#8221; and &#8220;voice-snd&#8221; sounds from the appropriate places.</p>
<p>You could try putting a request to the audacity-nyquist list, though.</p>

      <div class="comment"><p>Heh. I think I had some overzealous spam protection there for a while.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I&#8217;m about to release a new version with a new, better algorithm. I have initially written it in C# but could make it work (somewhat more slowly) in Audacity. If you have a standalone tool, would you still want the audacity plug-in? (If I don&#8217;t write a new audacity plug-in I&#8217;ll leave the old plug-in.)</p>

      <div class="comment"><p>I&#8217;ll look forward to your new version.  From my perspective, I think an Audacity plug-in would be useful.  To use a standalone tool I assume I&#8217;d need to export the audacity project to a single file and then re-import, right?  Plus I use a Mac&#8230; is my sense correct that it&#8217;s hard to make C# programs run on Mac?</p>

<p>I&#8217;m still getting lots of milage from your compressor.  Thanks for the advice about changing the slider ranges; that lets me know for sure my settings are what I want them to be.  I have another question about the noise floor, though &#8212; I&#8217;ve finally realized that it doesn&#8217;t behave as I had assumed.  Sections of audio beneath the noise floor are still raised, just not quite as much as if you don&#8217;t set a noise floor.  So if someone doesn&#8217;t speak for a couple seconds, you get a little hill of background noise in the middle of the break in speech.  So I changed &#8220;(defun limit-amp (samp) (if (and (&gt; floor 0) (&gt; samp max-gain)) max-gain samp))&#8221; to &#8220;(defun limit-amp (samp) (if (and (&gt; floor 0) (&gt; samp max-gain)) 1 samp))&#8221;.  This sort of does more like what I&#8217;d expect, though of course if something just barely breaks the noise floor, up it comes.  But I barely read Lisp, so I still don&#8217;t know how most of the compressor works, and I thought I&#8217;d get your reaction to this, and see if you had any other thoughts.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Allen</p>

      <div class="comment"><p>Yeah, I think what you&#8217;re looking for is a &#8220;noise gate&#8221;. Lots of compressors have them built in, but I don&#8217;t have one in mine because it&#8217;s not really appropriate for most classical music recordings, which is what I wrote the plugin for. Alas, it seems that most people use it for speech instead. I&#8217;m not sure how I&#8217;d go about implementing a <i>good</i> noise gate algorithm, because I haven&#8217;t ever thought about it. The naive noise gate algorithm is just what your change consists of, and I&#8217;m not sure how much you can improve on that. But you might look for another plugin to apply in a separate pass (probably before compression).</p>
<p>The other thing I might do is decrease the compression ratio and attack/falloff speeds a bit. (Normalizing before compressing would help too.) That way the compression isn&#8217;t much harsher overall, but noise isn&#8217;t boosted as much.</p>
<p>I guess a more general solution would be to generalize the compression ratio parameter into a function with a domain of input dB and range of output dB, which is how SoundForge&#8217;s compressor works. It would probably be relatively easy to implement, but Audacity doesn&#8217;t offer a good GUI for that, or a way to create one, so you&#8217;d have to tweak the file itself every time you changed the function. The function would just replace &#8220;adjust-samp&#8221;, and look something like this, I guess:</p>
<pre>(defun adjust-samp (db)
  (db-to-linear
    (cond
      ((&lt; db -30) 0)
      (t db))))
</pre>
<p>&#8220;cond&#8221; is like a switch statement, with &#8220;t&#8221; being the default clause. The maximum amplitude and noise floor parameters would become superfluous. The sample function there silences everything below -30 dB and applies no change to everything else. But ideally if you graphed the &#8220;adjust-samp&#8221; function it would be continuous. I don&#8217;t think adjust-samp actually works on samples, btw.</p>

      <div class="comment"><p>Thanks, Chris!  This is helpful.  I will play with noise gates, and with the adjust-samp function once I learn enough Nyquist to understand what&#8217;s going on.  So do you think we&#8217;re crazy to use your compressor on speech?  The conventional compressors may have some advantages, but the thing I like about yours is that it doesn&#8217;t miss any spikes.  The Audacity compressor misses spikes (like mic hits or cassette tape artifacts) during compression, but then the spikes keep the normalizer from bringing up the volume, so I end up having to remove the spikes by hand.  (Click removal doesn&#8217;t really seem to work; I&#8217;m not sure why.)  Also, what do you mean when you say you don&#8217;t think adjust-samp works on samples? </p>

      <div class="comment"><p>&#8220;So do you think we’re crazy to use your compressor on speech?&#8221;</p>
<p>Hey, if it works for you that&#8217;s great. I&#8217;m not surprised it does better than other sorts of compressors for some things. Nyquist comes with a compressor that&#8217;s similar to mine, but Audacity&#8217;s repackaging of Nyquist doesn&#8217;t include it (or a couple of library functions it uses).</p>
<p>&#8220;Click removal doesn’t really seem to work&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, clicks, pops, and other artifacts may sound similar but methods used to detect them can vary widely. For a microphone hitting something, I usually do a high-pass filter at around 20-50 Hz. It doesn&#8217;t get rid of the sound, but it gets rid of the peak in the waveform. For speech, I&#8217;d probably do a highpass to the whole thing. For dealing manually with big peaks, it&#8217;s pretty easy to use Audacity&#8217;s interactive envelope function to scale it way down.</p>
<p>&#8220;what do you mean when you say you don’t think adjust-samp works on samples&#8221;</p>
<p>The value passed to adjust-samp isn&#8217;t an individual sample, but part of the envelope that gets interpolated over the waveform. adjust-samp gets called once for each thousand samples.</p>

      <div class="comment"><p>Thanks for the great tool! We use your dynamic compressor for our PMlessonsLearned.com podcast. We record conference calls and then podcast them as MP3s.  Question: We are basically using the compressor to even out the volume of all of our speakers.

We just want to correct the volume from all these voices to make them all the same. Can you suggest how to set the compressor settings to make this work the best for our application?</p>

      <div class="comment"><p>Our goal is simply to keep the volume even throughout our podcast. Our podcast is a recorded conference call, so we have people calling in that are very loud and others who are very soft and everywhere in between. </p>
<p>We seem to have arrived at some good settings by just using the default settings with one change: we change the first number to .99 - If I interpret your writings correctly, this should allow all areas to be increased in amplification to the full .95 (last setting) very quickly, so we should be able to hear all callers on the conference call at about the same volume. </p>
<p>As far as I can tell, this is true for your &#8220;old&#8221; plug-in and the &#8220;new&#8221; one that has more settings. </p>
<p>Changing this one setting seems to cause all of the various &#8220;speakers&#8221; on our call to be brought to full volume. Which I think is what we want. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve run this on our audio and listened to random spots within and it seems this works well. The only issues are:</p>
<p>1. &#8220;quiet&#8221; (when nobody is talking) seems to slowly rise in volume. I know that&#8217;s what the floor is for, but I don&#8217;t think we can get around this because sometimes &#8220;quiet&#8221; is noisier than some of our callers (you can imagine background noise on someone&#8217;s phone who has lots of gain is louder than someone who&#8217;s phone has very little gain and is talking). So, I don&#8217;t think we can fix this one and it&#8217;s not too annoying.</p>
<p>2. Sometimes during &#8220;quiet&#8221; someone will make a noise we don&#8217;t want amplified. For example, I was listening to one piece of the audio where it sounded like someone in the background dropped a bunch of pots and pans in the background. Well, that was amplified too. Again, I don&#8217;t see any way to avoid this and it&#8217;s not too annoying.</p>
<p>So, I guess my questions are:<br />
1. Did I interpret the first setting correctly: .99 will amplify all parts of the audio all the way up to the value in the last setting (.95) no matter how quiet they are?<br />
2. Do you think changing the ramp up/down values would matter much to get us to full volume quicker? (We&#8217;re currently just using the defaults)</p>
<p>Thanks again for this wondrously useful tool!</p>

      <div class="comment"><p>Henry, your understanding of the compression ratio parameter (the first one) is correct. It is pretty much the same between versions.</p>
<p>The speed at which the quiet parts get louder is determined by the release speed. If you make that a little faster then the noise rising in volume might not be quite so noticable or annoying. The speed and which things get quieter (before loud parts) is the attack. In version 1.0 these were called rise and fall speeds, I forget which were which. Also, the different versions invert the effect of the sliders, I think. In the latest version, I think you want to lower them.</p>
<p>Anyway, the best handling of noise in your case is probably just selecting the quiet parts and using Audacity&#8217;s envelope tool to quieten them down manually. That&#8217;ll also take care of clumsy callers slipping in their kitchens.</p>

      <div class="comment"><p>Wonderfull compressor!!! Simply the best!</p>
<p>Can I make a suggestion?</p>
<p>1 - One option to normalize automatically before compression.<br />
2 - Parameters in dB.<br />
3 - A pre-processor to find the parameters that make volume fit in one range of db. Something like &#8216;minimum volume: 80 db; maximum volume: 96 db;&#8217;.</p>
<p>Some time ago, I have read something about K profiles about music compression. You can find more <a href="http://books.google.com.br/books?id=EBCmpwGCROMC&amp;pg=PA190&amp;lpg=PA190&amp;dq=K-20+K-12+compression&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zZP-xqyhEe&amp;sig=CgIpcNKan5lmDFt2385s6hffc20&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;ei=de-SScSYC5Kj-gboyvShCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ct=result" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p>Finally a question. I have my entire music collection that I would like to process it with your compressor. Do you know anything that could do this in batch?</p>

      <div class="comment"><p>Mauricio: I provide above a link to a Windows version of the compressor that is able to process batches of files at a time. (It also has a commandline interface.) Unfortunately, it does not do de/en-coding.</p>
<p>As to your second suggestion, my latest version of the audacity plugin, 1.2.1 (as of two days ago), has &#8216;floor&#8217; in dB, but the rise and fall parameters don&#8217;t relate to dB in any simple way. Noise gate falloff is in dB/s, so I might be able to change it if it&#8217;s not already scaled right. So I&#8217;m afraid that&#8217;s mostly not going to happen.</p>
<p>As to your first and third suggestion, that would require two passes, which would make the plugin much, much slower in Audacity. So I&#8217;m not going to do those. If you want to suggest a feature, suggest to the Audacity folks to let you create/save/load chains of effects and maybe even a batch mode. Though it does strike me that there&#8217;s not a way to do your third feature with other effects without trial and error.</p>
<p>I might implement the third feature in the windows version, though. Two passes can be handled more efficiently there.</p>
<p>Re you first suggestion, note that you can apply gain by changing the maximum amplitude property. The property isn&#8217;t relative to the peak value, but to 0 dB. I believe you can set it > 1. You get clipping if it&#8217;s too high, though.</p>

<p>I almost didn&#8217;t believe them when one of the other Audacity helpers told me about your compressor.  It&#8217;s so unlikely that a programmer would go through the right-brain exercise of making it sound right instead of just throwing theoretical code modules at it and call it good.

      <div class="comment"><p>Wow, looks like your compressor is finally getting the attention it deserves.  There&#8217;s a new thread over at the Audacity forums (http://audacityteam.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=9058) about some crash problems.  I mention there that I&#8217;ve been meaning to write you to say that it seems like the newest version crashes for me when my selected region starts very near, but not at, the beginning of the track.  But that I&#8217;ve been putting off writing you, because I want to experiment more and describe the problem more precisely.  Also, with really long files, I&#8217;ve noticed a teensy decrease in the length of the track after using the plug-in.  Roughly, compressing an hour of audio seems to make it about .05 seconds shorter.  Obviously not a big deal in itself, but I thought you might be interested.</p>

<p>&#8212;Can you tell me where the link is to download the compressor because I looked all through the link you gave me and could not find it.</p>
<p>&#8212;12th paragraph:<br />
&#8220;The other is an Audacity plugin, currently at version 1.2.1. To use it, download and install Audacity. Download the plugin source, &#8221;</p>
<p>Right click on the link &#8220;plugin source&#8221; and choose &#8220;Save As&#8221;, then save, copy, or move the downloaded file into the Audacity plugin folder.</p>

      <div class="comment"><p>No, but I&#8217;m not surprised. The 1.3 version of Audacity is going through some pretty stiff revisions and the Effects menu in particular has been schizophrenic.  You can tell which rev you&#8217;re in by the presentation order of the effects.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t know this would run in 1.2.6.  We&#8217;ve been sending people to Audacity 1.3 for this. Remember that the shiny new Mac/Intel people will be running 1.2.5, not 1.2.6. this catches about one person every two or three days.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been pushing many people over here to help with their compression problems, so anything you can do to make the process easier and more obvious is good.</p>

      <div class="comment"><p>Heh. The ampersand in 1.2.6 at least lets you press Alt+E+D to get the compressor. An ampersand shows up as an underline under the following character in Windows. Maybe it&#8217;s not portable to have that. Mainly it was for testing anyway.</p>
<p>OK, I&#8217;ve tweaked the name some. If you let me know what annotations to use in the .ny file to get it sorted right in the Effects menu, I&#8217;ll put those in as well.</p>

<p>Newbie trying to understand this tool, so I can script creation of my mostly-classical FLAC files into a parallel MP3 tree suitable for in-car iPod use.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve tried the Audacity plug-in, and understand the meaning of &#8220;attack&#8221; and &#8220;release&#8221; as described.</p>
<p>Does &#8220;attack&#8221; in the plug-in correspond with &#8220;fall&#8221; (time and exponent) on the standalone tools, &#8220;release&#8221; with &#8220;rise&#8221;?  That seems to be the way the default values line up, but the help text for the command-line version seems to associate &#8220;fall&#8221; with &#8220;release.&#8221;</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t really know for sure. Sorry. I can tell you that I don&#8217;t have the two very straight in my head, and I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re named very well either way, so they could very easily be crossed one way or another. I think the best way to tell is to experiment. The default values are probably the best clue.</p>

<p>1. It often lifts the last second/half second of music/vocal to an unnatural level compared to the rest of the piece - so that this end section doesnt appear to match. Is there any reason for this and a setting I could change to prevent this?</p>
<p>2. When applied to a piece 90 seconds long it compressed the first 6 seconds of speech then truncated the file at that point so that 1 min 24 of audio was lost. Is there a reason this might happen and a setting I can change to prevent this?</p>

      <div class="comment"><p>First off, congratulations on an awesome compressor.</p>
<p>Unfortunately there does appear to be a bug as Pete described in point 2 of his post (September 22nd, 2009).</p>
<p>I have not found an easy way to reproduce the bug on demand, but I have saved a project that exhibits the problem. It is a 4:35 stereo track, and when applying the dynamic compressor to the entire track it gets truncated at 3min 59.</p>
<p>This is the precise point where an audio clip was previously pasted. The project plays perfectly and there are no unusual effects from any other Nyquist effects.</p>
<p>I can send the .AUP file if it will help to track down the problem. I can&#8217;t make the entire project public as it is copyright material, so e-mail me if you need the whole thing.<br />
____________________</p>
<p>Re point 1) from the same post by Pete I usually work around by adding a second of generated tone or noise at amplitude 1.0 to the end of the track (then trimming it off after processing). This workaround is only required if the track ends abruptly. It would perhaps be nice if the plug-in could emulate this by setting an amplitude level of 1 at the end of the track when calculating the gain. (I don&#8217;t know if this is possible as I don&#8217;t fully understanding the code).</p>
<p>In the case where the track ends with a gradual fade out, the fade out may be boosted too much with the default settings, but increasing the &#8220;floor&#8221; setting fixes that.</p>

<p>I really ought to look into 1. Seems a lot of people have that problem. I should be able to reproduce it pretty easily. (Now that I&#8217;m temporarily jobless I should have some time to do this!)</p>
<p>2 is another question. It probably indicates a rare bug in my compressor, something I wouldn&#8217;t be able to reproduce. If you want me to fix this, you could send me a .wav or .aup file that exhibits the problem, or you could press the &#8220;Debug&#8221; button when applying the effect and send me the output. A possible workaround is to apply some other effect to the sound first (like normalize, invert, or equalize), which might avoid triggering the bug.</p>

<p>We need to remember that the AUP file is only the project manager.  To send anything meaningful, you also have to send the _DATA folder.  In addition, you have to have had Audacity set to Copy All Music, or the Project still isn&#8217;t going to play when it gets here.</p>

&lt;&gt;</p>
<p>This occurs if there is a long section of complete silence (over about 1 second of sample values at zero).</p>
<p>How to work around this:<br />
If you have a track with a long period of silence in it, process it in sections so as to avoid processing the silence.</p>
<p>Hopefully Chris will be able to fix this in a future version, but I am writing a longer description of the workaround on the Audacity help forum. I&#8217;ll post a link here when it&#8217;s done if that&#8217;s OK.</p>

      <div class="comment"><p>Hi Chris!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been using your wonderful compressor for quite some time now, and it has worked fine except for some cases where songs got truncated at the end.<br />
It was great to read that version 1.2.2 would fix this&#8230; Unfortunately, the new version has brought some new problems in; Audacity just crashes when trying to apply the compressor to some songs, which makes it absolutely useless for me at the moment. :(<br />
I don&#8217;t know if it happens to someone else, but it is very annoying, because now I don&#8217;t know where can I get 1.2.1 back.<br />
Hope this gets fixed soon&#8230;</p>
<p>Thanks for your efforts and keep up the good work!</p>

<p>I mean Audacity just disappears after applying the compressor. I just started using the new version today and worked fine with the first song; the second crashed every time. I tried to delete the last 2 seconds of the song, which are absolute silence, but it didn&#8217;t work.<br />
No errors or anything; Audacity asks me to recover the previous session when opening again but that&#8217;s it.</p>
<p>Just in case you need the info, I am currently running Audacity 1.3.5 in Ubuntu Hardy (8.04). I would use a newer version, but building from source in Hardy is a nightmare. There are built packages at Getdeb.net, but they are pretty buggy, so at the moment I am stuck with 1.3.5.</p>
<p>Again, thanks a lot!</p>

      <div class="comment"><p>GREAT plug-in! The default compressor in Audacity is very lackluster, making me to go though a long process for each track. Yours is much easier to use, faster, and give me much better results without constant tweaking of the parameters. And you&#8217;re completely right about the realtime compressors. Yours works much better on signal spikes cause by percussion. Thanks a bunch!</p>

Nyquist (in Audacity) was not fully compatible with Linux 64. This should be fixed in the current 1.3.11 version.</p>

<p>Also, Audacity currently keeps the sound file in memory while processing, so processing very large files can exhaust the computers available RAM.</p>

      <div class="comment"><p>Thanks for such a cool tool!!  I record long lectures. They quite often have unacceptable variations in level.  Speaker movement, house engineer changing the level on my feed, etc.etc.    HOWEVER!!   It dies at 30 minutes, on my computer, will check back from time to time hoping for a fix. I can&#8217;t dare to chop up the source soundtrack into small pieces, it would break the sync. with the video.</p>

      <div class="comment"><p>Hi todd, I&#8217;d like to help get you working. I can apply my plugin to very long tracks on my machine. I&#8217;ve e-mailed you with some questions. Note that applying my compressor to a selected part of an audacity track doesn&#8217;t change the timing at all, so you can just select the different parts of your track and apply the compressor to each one to work around this problem.</p>

i bought an outboard compressor for my stereo to play cds better &#8212;-</p>
<p>the loud sounds wake the baby nextdoor<br />
the low sounds are hidden underneath the trucks outside &#8212;-</p>
<p>with a 30db max range now i can finally enjoy classical music at home </p>
<p>it would be great to have a compressor that can do that do my recordings too so i can play them anywhere </p>
<p>and if i could get rid of that annoying click when the compressor goes from very low to very high that would be a plus</p>

      <div class="comment"><p>I didn&#8217;t read anything to guide me. I started out by noticing that normalizing was worthless, and trying to use the envelope function to manually remove some of the high peaks before normalizing. After doing this for a few hours, I got a feel for some of the effective techniques, and I decided to try to automate them. I was already an experienced programmer, and I happened to know the audacity extension language, so this turned out to be not terribly hard.</p>

<p>Would you please consider re-adding the advanced features, perhaps by a button that can switch between advanced and simple. Is the &#8220;hardness&#8221; equivalent to the attack release options before? What is the new exponent in the simplified settings?</p>

      <div class="comment"><p>Ramen: please look in the source of the plugin for instructions on how to re-enable the advanced features. (You just comment out some lines and uncomment others.) The tutorial mentions this, so hopefully new users will be able to find out about them. I would definitely make it a button to switch, but I have very little control over the parameters screen. I basically just set the parameter name and ranges, and I can&#8217;t do anything else.</p>
<p>The hardness adjusts the two width settings in sync, on a x^2 scale. The exponents just stay at the defaults.</p>
<p>You can get to any old version by the following scheme:</p>
<p><a href="../../projects/compressor/compress-1.X.Y.html" rel="nofollow">http://pdf23ds.net/projects/compressor/compress-1.X.Y.ny</a> (e.g. compress-1.2.5.ny).</p>
<p>BTW, 1.2.6 doesn&#8217;t change the compressor algorithm. Results with the default settings should be identical.</p>
<p><i>The one other thing I think your plugin desperately needs is a way to save presets, or at least remember my previously used settings between Audacity reboots.</i></p>
<p>Huh. That really sucks. Someone should bug the audacity developers to get that fixed. Unfortunately (due to the limited control I have on the parameters screen) I can&#8217;t fix it.</p>

<p>&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Thanks for pointing these things out. I&#8217;ve passed the information on to the folk at the Audacity forum.</p>
<p>I like the new simplified interface though I would personally prefer to have separate controls for attack and release rather than the combined &#8220;hardness&#8221;. Could this perhaps be a happy compromise between the old and new interfaces?</p>
<p>Do you have any plans to make this plug-in GPL compatible?<br />
I&#8217;d really like to try and get this effect included in the Audacity download bundle, but that is currently prohibited by the licensing terms. You would of course still be credited as the author of the plug-in and it is common for plug-in authors to have their name/website listed at the top of the GUI.</p>

      <div class="comment"><p>Steve, I&#8217;m not sure exactly what you typed in to do the quotes, but on blog comments (especially wordpress and typepad) it&#8217;s generally a good idea to stay away from using angle brackets too much. They often get messed up, especially if you don&#8217;t surround them with spaces. For quoting try using &lt;i&gt;text&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;blockquote&gt;. phpBB and blogger are good about angle brackets though.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t want to show the exponent parameters, you can just refrain from uncommenting those (i.e. ignore the second &#8220;advanced parameters&#8221; section in the source code) and it&#8217;ll do the expected thing.</p>
<p>Did I switch the order of release/attack speed at some point? I don&#8217;t remember doing so. Have they been backwards the whole time? Oh, yes. I renamed them from rise/fall. I guess I could switch them.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll think about the licensing.</p>

<p>Jon, I&#8217;m not sure what dual-licensing accomplishes when one of the licenses is GPL. In any case, I doubt I will ever even try to make money off of this, so I&#8217;ll probably put it under the GPL one of these days, when I get around to it.</p>

It looks like a great plugin, and I really need more options for a compressor than what is offered by default by Audacity.</p>

      <div class="comment"><p>Yeah, that&#8217;s what I get for not testing the stupid thing. (Integer division should have been float division.) Try the same link again.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s really no great environment for developing audacity plugins. You could try the Nyquist environment, but it&#8217;s pretty primitive. It maps pretty well with Audacity (since Audacity uses Nyquist as the engine for those plugins). I never did use it though. I just used my favorite programmer&#8217;s text editor and used lots of debug output to files and such. I already knew Lisp from using a lot of Common Lisp. For that I used SBCL/Emacs/Slime (on Linux).</p>
<p>When I wrote version 2 of the plugin I actually wrote it in C# 2 with Visual Studio first, and then converted the algorithm back to XLisp. It would have been much harder otherwise. VS has recompile-as-you-go and a good debugger and GUI libraries to display graphs of debugging information. (When writing version 1 I actually used gplot and file output from audacity.)</p>

      <div class="comment"><p>I&#8217;m really confused. Not so much by the math, but by what to do.</p>
<p>First, I downloaded the plugin version and couldn&#8217;t figure out how to activate it. I went to Effect &gt; Compressor and clicked on Compressor and what came up was Dynamic Range Compressor by Dominic Mazzoni. Is this you?</p>
<p>So, then I tried the stand alone. I have Windows 7, so wasn&#8217;t sure if I should even try to use this one. I&#8217;m not sure what to do with it anyway.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve read through the main page and the tutorial and I still don&#8217;t know what to do. None of the tutorial text and the Chris&#8217;s dynamic compressor GUI seem to have terms in common. I see Compression level:, Noise floor:, Release speed, Release exponent, Attack speed, Attack exponent, and Renormalization factor: as things I can adjust, but don&#8217;t find any reference to any of those titles in the tutorial. I was hoping for: to get this effect, slide this bar until it reads x.</p>

      <div class="comment"><p>Al: The Effects menu has two sections separated by a horizontal bar. Plugins show up in the bottom section. (In some versions of Audacity there&#8217;s a submenu called &#8220;Plugins&#8221;.) My entry says &#8220;Compress dynamics&#8230;&#8221;.</p>
<p>Yeah, I really do need to make the two have consistent terminology. The GUI doesn&#8217;t have much help in there either. I should work on that. In the meantime, here&#8217;s how they correspond:</p>
<p>release speed = release time<br />
attack speed = attack time<br />
compression level = compress ratio<br />
noise floor = floor<br />
renormalization = maximum amplitude<br />
noise gate falloff isn&#8217;t in the windows version</p>
<p>Practically speaking, the defaults in either plugin should work just fine. If you want to change something, most of the time all you need to change is the first parameter, the compress ratio or compression level. Everything else is just for tweaking the result.</p>

      <div class="comment"><p>Hello there, downloaded the Newest Beta version 1.2.7, of it to my Win XP Pro PC, but it does not know what program to use to open it, I have the latest .NetFramework installed too. I Was able to download and install the older 1.2.6 version of it though, I am still learning about all these very cool Plugins can use like this, but my question is: when I install them, should I install all Plug ins into Audacity Beta Unicode Plugin Folder since I am using the Beta version, or just the regular Audacity Plugin folder that I also see on my Cdrive, does it matter? Tried both, but when I restart Audacity Beta, do not see them in My Effects screen, only the built in Audacity Compressor or plug ins etc??</p>
<p>Also I tried searching Chris&#8217;s Compressor Program more on how to use to Batch process all my Mp3 Playlists in their Existing order in Itunes 10 (Approx 2,200 songs only) to Same, best Amplified Peak Levels without trimming, would like to do all of them at one time in the new Audacity 1.3.12 Beta, still unsure if have to painstakenly do one song at a time, or could set a specific peak level to sync all existing and newly added songs together in my Itunes playlists? Please advise if you can advise anything Suggestions at all.<br />
Much appreciated and thanks for your time!!!</p>

<p>You should see it. I don&#8217;t know why you aren&#8217;t. It&#8217;s down in the bottom half of the menu, and it says &#8220;Compress dynamics&#8230;&#8221;.</p>

<p>Run Compressor.exe from the Compressor-dotnet.zip zip file. (Also get LAME.) Drag the folder with all your MP3 files over into it. </p>
<p>This process is not very streamlined yet. It might not be accessible to unskilled computer users yet.</p>

      <div class="comment"><p>Dear Mr. Capel:</p>
<p>Thank you so very much for making your dynamic compressor and for making it available.  I was listening to a piece of choral music which contained a very loud finale, which drove my little cheapo speakers into severe distortion.  I knew I needed a dynamic compressor and I found your site.   I downloaded you Windows plugin for Audacity, which I use mainly for a MP3 recorder, transposer, and tempo adjuster.  I put your file into the folder with the other .ny files. Unfortunately I can find any instructions on usage.  Perhaps you could include a sentence or so covering this topic.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>

to post some feedback to you.<br />
I have been using NCH WavPad 3.02a since 2006.  I also use Audacity now.  NCHWP has an audio effect called Automatic Gain Control.  It would be nice Audacity has a similar effect.  My comments at the above thread describe the effect &#8230;<br />

      <div class="comment"><p>AEN, if you post a link to a before and after with the WavPad effect (or e-mail me one), I can tell you if the effect is possible with my plugin.</p>
<p>Generally, to get a softer effect, you decrease the compression level, and decrease the compression hardness. If you&#8217;re not seeing a &#8220;compression hardness&#8221; parameter, then you&#8217;ve downloaded the advanced version, and you should increase the attack and release speeds. You can also try slightly lowering the exponent parameters.</p>
<p>Try these settings: compression level 0.5, release speed 1500, attack speed 800, floor -24, release exponent 1.7. If the sound dips before peaks too much, lower the attack speed again. If you want to keep more of the overall dynamic range (i.e. the depth of the dips) then lower the compression level more. If you want to decrease the overall level of the result, try changing &#8220;renormalize&#8221; to .85.</p>
<p>I should probably change &#8220;speed&#8221; to &#8220;time&#8221;. Conceptually, &#8220;raising the speed&#8221; would make the attack and release faster/harder, but raising those parameters makes them slower/softer.</p>

      <div class="comment"><p>Visarga: The lame version required for the default arguments given to lame is 3.98. You can use older versions of lame if you remove the id3 tag option. Lame has no option to just copy over all the tags, so you&#8217;ll have to do that manually. I know it&#8217;s a pain. If anyone can suggest a program that will run from the command line that will copy tags, I will consider including it in my program. I use MP3Tag to copy the tags manually after compressing them. It makes the process pretty quick, and it supports iTunes songs too.</p>
<p>I will consider adding a preset list. It isn&#8217;t supported by Audacity, but the Windows version could support it, I suppose.</p>
<p>A Windows Media Player version is not available. It would require me learning quite a bit to make one, so it&#8217;s not going to happen any time in the foreseeable future, unless someone wants to contribute to a fund for me to write one.</p>
<p>To install the plugin for Audacity on a Mac, you simply drop the .ny file into the /Applications/Audacity/plug-ins folder instead of C:\Program Files\Audacity\plug-ins.</p>
<p>Harvey, I&#8217;ll e-mail you.</p>

      <div class="comment"><p>[...] Finally, had issues with to much volume variations throughout the podcast. When a high volume sentence was placed between two low volume sentences, the listener could tell one it was spliced in. After looking around the interwebs, I found a plugin. I copied and pasted it into Audicity to have a more fine-tuned control over compression (don&#8217;t ask me what it is, I just hear the difference). The one I downloaded was called Dynamic Compressor. It had alot of options, which were explained right there while you tweeked them. Overall, I was happy with its ease of use and effectiveness. I found this plugin in at <a href="index.html" rel="nofollow">http://pdf23ds.net/software/dynamic-compressor/</a>. [...]</p>
